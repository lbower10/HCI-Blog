        <p>
            Project 1 instructed us to create a game using our 8x8 LED matrix
            using an inventive input type of our choosing. My partner, Dean Longmire, and I decided to
            try and create a game that resembled the popular video game "Guitar Hero."
            We first programmed our LED matrix to randomly generate a number that 
            coresponds to a column in the matrix (46 through 53). We then programmed the matrix
            to light up two LEDs side by side. These pairs represent our "notes" that the
            user must match. The matching is done by three buttons, our inventive input, corresponding to three
            rows on the matrix in which the notes fall from.

            Coming from a Computer Science background, the majority of the
            time on this project was spent simply trying to figure out setting
            up the circuit and how to correctly light up areas of the matrix We
            wanted to light up. Once this was done, writing the actual game logic was
            <i>relatively</i> simple (Thanks Computer Science!).

            Above is a snippet of code that demonstrates how we light up
            an LED on our matrix. We simply write the column to HIGH, and the row to LOW.
            This allows us to choose the specific LED that we want to emit light from.
            We also write the row next to the parametered row HIGH, as our notes are in pairs.

            Above is a snippet of code that initializes our LED matrix.
            We set pins 22 - 29 (rows) and pins 46 - 53 (columns) to output mode.
            We initialize the columns to HIGH so that the matrix begins without being lit up.

            Here is a snippet of gameplay in the early levels of our game.
            You can see the game logs in the terminal that show what level
            the player is on, as well as the green RGB LED that blinks when
            the player successfully hits the correct note.

            Here is a snippet of gameplay where the player has progressed
            and reached a higher level in the game. You will observe how the notes
            fall faster, and the player must react accordingly. When the player loses the game,
            the RGB LED will blink red to indicate game over.
