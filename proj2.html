        <p>
            Project 2 instructed us to be creative and design our own
            primary input device. After brainstorming/pondering what device
            we might make, we settled on using conductive Play-Dough for
            obtaining user input.

        <h2>The Game</h2>

        <p>
            The main idea of our game is for players to guess
            each others' input correctly. The arduino and other components will 
            sit in a shoebox, or some other kind of encasing, with a divider in the middle
            and onnings on either side. These onnings will shield the conductive Play-Dough
            inputs from a player's opponent. Player 1 will press one of his input devices,
            which will be either red, green, or blue Play-Dough. It is then Player 2's job
            to correectly match Player 1's input. A player will score if their opponent does
            not guess correctly OR if they correctly guess what their opponent selected.
