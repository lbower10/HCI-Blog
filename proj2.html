        <h1>Project 2: Two-Player Color Matching</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="normdiv">
        <p>
            Project 2 instructed us to be creative and design our own
            primary input device. After brainstorming/pondering what device
            we might make, we settled on using conductive Play-Dough for
            obtaining user input.

        <h2>The Game</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="normdiv">
        <p>
            The main idea of our game is for players to guess
            each others' input correctly. The arduino and other components will 
            sit in a shoebox, or some other kind of encasing, with a divider in the middle
            and awnings on either side. These awnings will shield the conductive Play-Dough
            inputs from a player's opponent. Player 1 will press one of his input devices,
            which will be either red, green, or blue Play-Dough. It is then Player 2's job
            to correctly match Player 1's input. A player will score if their opponent does
            not guess correctly OR if they correctly guess what their opponent selected.

        <h2>Play Dough Time!</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="normdiv">
        <p>
            We used an old shoebox as a shell to our game to keep any wires out of view. We also applied 
            LEDs, outer input clamps, and the stand-in play-doh balls to provide us with a strongly visual 
            prototype to help us envision the project better. Wires were strategically paired with their corresponding 
            play-doh balls for visual appeal and decreased chance of human error when doing the internal wiring. It was 
            at this point that we also decided to only make the games first to three since adding more LEDs would 
            be difficult with the limited space and amount of wires we were already using.

            As we mentioned earlier, the wiring was extensive for this many input and output devices. Because we ensured  
            that wire coloring was consistent, there were only a few small errors that were easy to deal with.

            Once we were able to get all the LEDs to power on, we decided to start formulating and 
            writing code that would run the game.

        <p>
            We programmed some AI to play our game using rng.
            This was to show how the gameplay would flow.
            You can see that when a player makes their guess,
            the three LEDs in the middle flash, indicating that
            the turns have switched. You can also see the scorekeeping
            yellow LEDs on the side needing three points to win.

            There were still things that needed to be more fleshed out and polished, but for the time being, 
            we wanted to first get our star component integrated into the system.

        <h2>Creating Conductive Play Dough Input</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="normdiv">
        <p>
            Following these simple <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-make-conductive-play-dough/" target="_blank">instructions</a>, 
            we were able to cook our own play-doh capable of holding 
            a charge, allowing us to detect a change of capacitance when contacted by skin.

        <h3>Conductivity Testing</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="normdiv">
        <p>
            In order to easily measure capacitance of a conductive surface, we used an Arduino 
            library called <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/capacitivesensor/" target="_blank">CapacitanceSensor.h</a> 
            that used a function to measure it for us if provided the correct pins. This was just a simple circuit to check if the play-doh had 
            the desired properties, and it did! Each ball used in the system will have a clone of this circuit that consists of a digital read pin, 1M ohm resistor, 
            and a 'ground' to the specified pin, in this case, 2.

        <h2>Showcasing Input Reactivity</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="normdiv">
        <p>
            The inputs ended up being extremely responsive to the touch and worked exactly as we needed them to for the game. 
            The only issue we ran into was that when placing the game on a conductive surface, such as a metal table, 
            the readings will be inconsistent and unresponsive. This is because the table's conductive surface connects all the 
            play-doh balls in the same circuit, causing unpredictable behavior. However, this can be easily mitigated by placing 
            all balls on a paper towel.
